## 🗂️ Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Engineering (SQL)
- Designed relational database
- Loaded CSV data
- Validated data quality
- Performed exploratory analysis
- Built master dataset

### 2️⃣ Data Analysis (SQL)
- Dropout vs Engagement
- Dropout by Course Difficulty
- Paid vs Free Subscription Retention
- Behavioral indicators of dropout

### 3️⃣ Visualization (Power BI)
- KPIs: Dropout %, Engagement Score
- Risk segmentation
- Course & subscription impact
- Actionable insights

### 4️⃣ Machine Learning (R – Upcoming)
- Dropout prediction model
- Feature importance
- Early risk detection

## 📈 Key Business Questions Answered

- Do inactive learners drop out more? → **Yes**
- Does engagement reduce dropout risk? → **Strong negative correlation**
- Which course difficulty has higher dropouts? → **Advanced**
- Does subscription type affect retention? → **Paid users retain better**
- Can we detect high-risk learners early? → **Yes, via engagement & login metrics**

---

## 🎯 Final Conclusion
Learner dropouts are highly driven by inactivity, low engagement, advanced course difficulty, and free subscriptions.  
Early identification of high-risk learners enables proactive retention strategies.
